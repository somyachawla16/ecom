# Cart Application

A simple **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)** project that implements a shopping cart system using Reactâ€™s **Context API + useReducer** for global state management and **Express Sessions** for backend cart persistence.

---

**Frontend:**

- React Router v6
- React Context API + `useReducer` for global cart store
- Fetch API for backend communication

**Backend:**

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) for unique session handling
- REST API routes for cart and checkout management

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>= 18)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** running locally (default port `27017`)

### Working of Frontend

- The frontend uses useReducer and useContext to manage a global cart store.

- Products can be added, removed, and their quantities updated.

- The cart context is shared across pages using a global <CartProvider />.

- When checking out, the frontend calls the backend /api/checkout endpoint with user details (name, email).

### Working of backend

- Each user session is tracked using express-session, ensuring a unique cartId for every visitor.

- Cart items are stored in MongoDB based on sessionID.

- On checkout, a new Checkout document is created in MongoDB, containing the cart, user info, and session ID.

### Implementated

- Cart management (add/update) implemented using React context.
- Session handling implemented using express-session.

- Checkout API route implemented on the backend (/api/checkout).

- Checkout Page and Bill generation.

- Backend ready for future expansion (user authentication, product management, etc.).

### Pending Implemenation

- User feedback system for action perform.
- Delete Feature.
- Cart Flush.
- Some functionality need modification to stop re render and single click response.
- Cart Removal After bill generation.
- Reimplemenation context api with state management lib.
